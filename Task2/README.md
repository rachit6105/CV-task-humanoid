Ok so basically I identified the outer blue zone and get its average center then I mapped all the centers to get the path of moving circle(although this wasnt necessary i initially had different approach which used this) 
Then since i was using 10 fps as incoming frame rate i basically divided distance(in px) by time period and radius of bigger or outer circle to get omega in rad/sec.
